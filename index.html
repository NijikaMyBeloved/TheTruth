            >The ten-episode series presents a revisionist perspective on World
            War II, focusing on Nazi Germany. However, it has faced widespread
            criticism for promoting conspiracy theories, historical
            inaccuracies, and Holocaust denial. The documentary has been widely
            discredited by historians and experts for distorting facts and
            spreading far-right ideologies. Due to its controversial and
            misleading content, many platforms and streaming services have
            banned or removed the series. It is important for viewers to
            approach such materials critically and rely on well-established
            sources for accurate historical information. Holocaust denial, as
            presented in the documentary, is not supported by credible evidence
            and is widely condemned for promoting hatred and intolerance.</span
